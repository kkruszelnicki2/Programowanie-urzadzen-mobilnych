This is repository for course called "Programming mobile devices"

First 3 folders called "Lista[1-4]" contains all training tasks that had to be done in order to finish course. All apps are done with Kotlin in Android Studio. 
During the course I've learned all the basics of programming mobile applications like fragments, recyclerviews and adapters, basics of Kotlin, navigation, storing data with json and more.

Last folder called "Project" is (as the name points out) a final project, which I created to finish the course. It's a simple calendar type application, where you can pin events to make sure you don't forget about them! 
Project itself uses RecyclerView to show a list of events, json to store data and navigation to move between fragments. With this app you can create events, delete them and change them. Also calendar tells you when the event has passed by painting it red.
